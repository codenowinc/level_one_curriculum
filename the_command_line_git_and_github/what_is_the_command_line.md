# What is the Command Line?
The command-line user interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

The command line we'll be working with throughout this workshop is the one on the bottom half of the screen in your Cloud9 workspace.

The command line is a text-based interface that represents the environment your working in. You are probably familiar with using the GUI or graphical user interface to navigate your computer.

>Stop and ask your students if they have any questions so far. This a vast concept that is being condensed into a small explanation. It may be easier to help them wrap their heads around it by directly answering questions they have.
